# Melbourne Housing Prices Prediction
This project explores the Melbourne housing dataset and builds predictive models to estimate property prices using various regression techniques. The goal is to gain insights into housing trends and identify key factors that influence property values.

## Dataset
The dataset used is availabe in the data folder and it contains information such as:
- Suburb
- Type of property
- Rooms,Bathrooms,Bedrooms
- Distance
- Sale method
- Price (Target variable)

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns
- Preprocess and clean the data
- Handle missing values and encode categoriu=cal variables
- Apply multiple regression algorithms to predict house prices
- Evaluate models using R^2, RMSE, MAE
- Visualize predictions vs actual values
- Interpret model perfomance

## Tools and libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit learn
- RandomForestRegressor
- Ridge
- Lasso
- Linear Regression
- Jupyter Notebook

## Insights
- Price distribution is right skewed and benefits from log transformation
- Certain council areas are associated with higher average prices
- More rooms and proximity to the CBD leads to higher prices
